There are also two stops outside with lines going directly to the centre of Melbourne. Hostelworld guests tell us this hostel has a friendly party atmosphere and helpful staff who provide nightly themes, parties and games in the lively onsite bar. We like that all their rooms are ensuite.","hostelSays":"We offer a lot of great extras, like free pancake nights every Monday and free BBQ nights every Wednesday. Plus, every guest gets a free drink on arrival and every room is ensuite. \r\nWe're  located a few hundred metres from the iconic St Kilda Beach, and is a stone's throw from the historic Acland Street shopping precinct. At the same time, we are only a short tram ride from the city centre or Chapel Street shopping districts and a 10-minute walk to the Fitzroy Street nightlife district. Personally I love the walk along St Kilda Pier at sunset, where you get the very best spectacular view of the Melbourne City Skyline as well as of the cute St Kilda Penguins on the pier rocks.\r\nI think we present a welcoming environment for guests of all ages, though, being a youth hostel, we do cater to the backpacker market. Having said that, we very regularly have mature-age guests staying with us who very much enjoying their time here in St Kilda.\r\nWe are very wheelchair friendly and have an onsite lift as well as rooms which are equipped for special needs guests in both 4 bed rooms and private rooms. Only a handful of these rooms are available so we do need prior notice to ensure availability.","location":{"address1":"17 Carlisle St","address2":"St Kilda","city":{"id":21,"name":"Melbourne","nameEN":"Melbourne"},"country":{"id":13,"name":"Australia","nameEN":"Australia"},"region":{"id":78,"name":"Victoria","nameEN":"Victoria"},"latitude":"-37.8672717","longitude":"144.9799419","distance":{"kilometers":6.07,"miles":3.77}},"maxGuestsPerBooking":5,"depositPercentage":15,"ratings":{"security":98,"location":96,"staff":99,"atmosphere":96,"clean":92,"facilities":92,"value":95,"overall":96,"ratingsCount":3416},"groupInformation":{"listingInfo":"","terms":"","cancellationTerms":"","additionalTerms":"No groups available from October - March","typesNotAccepted":["JUNIORPRIMARYSCHOOL","HIGHSECONDARYSCHOOL","BUSINESSTRIP"],"remainderDue":"ON2WEEKS","ageRangesAccepted":["18-21","21-35"],"maxGuestsPerBooking":10},"currency":"AUD","houseRules":{"notes":"Nonrefundable or last minute bookings are non cancelable, non exchangeable and non refundable whatever the reason for the cancellation.
