We love a few drinks, great music and a dash of art. If you are looking to meet new people, have a laugh, and to be a part of great activities then come join the fun.\r\n\r\nOur location is perfect; we are the closest hostel to everything that matters. We are the only hostel within easy walking distance to the beach and koala hospital, we are also the closest hostel to the bars and town center. Just check out our location on the hostel map view thingy! We are not the closest hostel to Mordor if you happen to have a ring you are trying to dispose of.\r\n\r\nLike you, we want to keep the world healthy; which is why we get our power directly from the sun via our recently installed solar panels. We also have filtered rainwater tanks for our showers and bathroom sinks.\r\n\r\n24 hour kitchen and lounge area are yours. Our main aim is to make you feel like the hostel is your home too.\r\n\r\nWe created this hostel for you. Yes, specifically for you. If you choose a different hostel it will be like we planned you a party and you didn't show up. \r\n\r\nWe are young backpackers who simply love backpacking, we are creating the type of hostel we love finding in our adventures around the world. For this reason the hostel has a very unique atmosphere. Our focus is on creating a nice friendly environment where people can meet other guests easily, whether it be over a beer or through various activities. \r\n\r\nWe also wanted a hostel with great art. A good friend of ours recently won the Australian Raw awards visual artist of the year - she has been furiously painting all types of beauty on our walls. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo if you are a little adventures, a little quirky, and want something different than your average 'Mr Monopoly' hostel, then come join us.\r\n\r\nWelcome Vlkommen Bienvenue Huan ying Vitejte Velkommen Welkom Bonvenon Tere tulemast Tervetuloa Wolkom Willkommen \r\n\r\nOur target market is Backpackers between the ages of 18-35.
