{"type":"HOSTEL","name":"Royal Hotel Capertee","nameEN":"Royal Hotel Capertee","isActive":true,"isNew":false,"description":"The Royal Hotel is your hub for all things Capertee, whether you are visiting the Capertee Valley (the 2nd largest Canyon in the World), or the Turon River, whether you are bushwalking, camping, birdwatching, fishing, or even gold panning, make the Royal Hotel your Central Point.\r\n\r\nThe last Pub/Hotel left on the Castlereagh Highway (Mudgee Road), the main road between Lithgow and Mudgee, the Royal Hotel has everything you need for your trip.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Hotel is rich with history, the first timber version of the hotel was built around 1840 but it tragically burnt down in the early 1890's. The story goes that the ladies of the community were fed up with their men spending too much time at the pub, so they torched it!\r\n\r\nThe original timber building was replaced with a stone building in 1895 and it still stands proudly today. In 1880 the hotel became a railhead (where a railway line ends). In the old days, it used to be a three-week trip to Sydney but suddenly the railway line arrived and the trip became less than 24 hours.\r\n\r\nBack then, there was more than 3,500 people living in Capertee whereas numbers have now dwindled to around 180. Fire seems to be a recurring theme at The Royal because in 1930, a traveling salesman left a candle next to a window and the curtains caught alight. But just as the fabled phoenix arises from the ashes, so too does the Royal Hotel Capertee.\r\n\r\nAs a licensed premises, at least one guest in each room must be a responsible adult over the age of 18.\r\nWhilst we encourage groups to enjoy themselves, guests in the Pub area downstairs late at night, are requested to keep in mind that there are Hotel guests upstairs and unnecessary noise should be kept to a minimum.\r\nWe also request that guests respect our neighbors and not enter their properties.\r\n\r\nCancellation Policy: The guest can cancel free of charge until 24 hours before check-in time (2pm AEST). If cancelled within the 24-hour period, the guest will be charged the cost of the first night.","hostelworldSays":null,"hostelSays":null,"location":{"address1":"67 Castlereagh Highway, Capertee","address2":"","city":{"id":3241,"name":"Blue Mountains","nameEN":"Blue Mountains"},"country":{"id":13,"name":"Australia","nameEN":"Australia"},"region":{"id":39,"name":"Blue Mountains","nameEN":"Blue Mountains"},"latitude":"-33.1455330","longitude":"149.9819230","distance":{"kilometers":71.77,"miles":44.6}},"maxGuestsPerBooking":8,"depositPercentage":15,"ratings":{"security":0,"location":0,"staff":0,"atmosphere":0,"clean":0,"facilities":0,"value":0,"overall":0,"ratingsCount":0},"groupInformation":{"listingInfo":"","terms":"","cancellationTerms":"","additionalTerms":"","typesNotAccepted":["JUNIORPRIMARYSCHOOL","HIGHSECONDARYSCHOOL"],"remainderDue":"ON1WEEK","ageRangesAccepted":["18-21","21-35","35-50","50+"],"maxGuestsPerBooking":20},"currency":"AUD","houseRules":{"notes":"As a licensed premises, at least one guest in each room must be a responsible adult over the age of 18.\r\nWhilst we encourage groups to enjoy themselves, guests in the Pub area downstairs late at night, are requested to keep in mind that there are Hotel guests upstairs and unnecessary noise should be kept to a minimum.\r\nWe also request that guests respect our neighbors and not enter their properties.\r\n\r\nCancellation Policy: The guest can cancel free of charge until 24 hours before check-in time (2pm AEST).
