Hostelworld guests have said this is ?a great hostel to arrive to in Melbourne, especially just getting off of a long flight?. This hostel has clean, bright and airy rooms with high ceilings and our users say they particularly appreciate the ?awesome courtyard with picnic tables/sun loungers/ping-pong table/dart board?. Several travellers tell us they plan to stay here again because ?weekends here are party central?.","hostelSays":"We're located in one of Melbourne's most impressive and striking heritage-listed building. Even though the building looks huge, we're one of Melbourne's smaller hostels so guests receive more personal service. We have free wine and cheese nights on Wednesdays and 'Sausage Sizzles' on Sundays on the BBQ. There's also regular social nights out, including bowling, footy nights, fancy dress pub crawls and more, plus free DVD hire, a PlayStation games area and a large, sunny garden complete with picnic tables and sun loungers, right smack in the middle of the city!\r\nOur location means you can easily walk to many of Melbourne's major attractions such as Chinatown, Queen Victoria Markets, Melbourne Museum and many, many more! The free City Circle tram and tram 96 to St. Kilda beach leave from our doorstep. One of my favourite local areas is Brunswick St; it's literally a short stroll away, where guests can find many funky cafés offering a wide range of cheap meals along with some of the best and most unique shops in Melbourne. Brunswick St is also highly regarded for its pubs and bars, many offering a variety of different live music.","location":{"address1":"66-90 Victoria
