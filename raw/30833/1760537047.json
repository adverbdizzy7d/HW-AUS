{"type":"HOSTEL","name":"Spinner's Backpackers","nameEN":"Spinner's Backpackers","isActive":true,"isNew":false,"description":"Perths favourite hostel re-launched. The new Spinners is now open.\r\n\r\nWith 25 years experience as Perth’s most chilled hostel, we’ve had some time to design the perfect zones for you. Those same chilled vibes are still here. But everything else is new. Like the new design led bedrooms with personalised charging stations aside every bed, bathrooms with built in hairdryers, wrap around garden courtyard commercial kitchen and air-conditioning in every room. Oh, and the really, really, really fast free internet. \r\n\r\nWhatever Hostel life means to you – Netflix on the couch, drinking in the alfresco garden, entertaining with a late arvo BBQ or just a drink and a game of pool. Spinners has you.\r\n\r\nSituated on the fringe of Northbridge, you’re where all the locals wish they lived.  With all the local cafes, shops, bars and nightclubs just down the street you’ve got the best of both worlds. Close enough to walk– but far enough away so you don’t get that late noise noise and riff-raff. We also have a free cat buss service will pick you up 3min from the front door and take you to any of the Perth City tourist locations. We are happy to assist in any other travel arrangements you may require, including tours, Rottnest trips, day activities and airport shuttle services.  \r\n\r\nWe are an international backpacker hostel requiring our guests be 18+ years of age and have a foreign passport for identification.","hostelworldSays":null,"hostelSays":null,"location":{"address1":"342 Newcastle Street","address2":"Northbridge, Perth, Western Australia","city":{"id":17,"name":"Perth","nameEN":"Perth"},"country":{"id":13,"name":"Australia","nameEN":"Australia"},"region":{"id":81,"name":"Western Australia","nameEN":"Western Australia"},"latitude":"-31.9434933","longitude":"115.8556377","distance":{"kilometers":1.35,"miles":0.84}},"maxGuestsPerBooking":8,"depositPercentage":15,"ratings":{"security":97,"location":91,"staff":92,"atmosphere":89,"clean":98,"facilities":94,"value":89,"overall":93,"ratingsCount":842},"groupInformation":null,"currency":"AUD","houseRules":{"notes":"You must have an international passport.\r\n\r\nAfter Hours please ring the doorbell at the front gate or call us ( our contact number could be found in your confirmation letter).\r\n\r\nNoise:\r\n\r\nFor the comfort of all guests, Spinner's Hostel has a no noise policy after 10:30pm in all dorms and a low noise policy in communal areas after 11:00pm.
