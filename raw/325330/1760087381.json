{"type":"HOSTEL","name":"Halse Lodge Noosa Heads","nameEN":"Halse Lodge Noosa Heads","isActive":true,"isNew":false,"description":"Halse Lodge re-opened its doors in November 2024 after full renovation.  Originally built in the 1880s, every corner tells a story inherently tied to the land. This iconic heritage listed two-storey backpackers has been carefully re-designed and revived in leisurely comfort. \r\n \r\nConnect with others in a casual, modern, light-filled dorm, or find solace in a private suite—perfect for friends and couples.  Rest, relax, and capture core moments amidst vibrant interiors that celebrate the spirit of Australiana.\r\n \r\nHalse Lodge embodies the true energy of Noosa, and features all the modern, luxurious comforts – sleep in air-conditioned comfort with brand-new cozy hotel quality mattresses, and enjoy new bathrooms with lux amenities, as well as access to laundry and communal kitchens.\r\n \r\nEnjoy full access to our Halse Lodge community spaces – yoga on the deck, table tennis tournaments and long games of pool, evenings soundtracked by classic vinyls and surfboards strewn in the sand. We’re only a short stroll from the golden sands of Noosa Main Beach, your playground for swimming, surfing, or simply soaking in the sun. Explore the vibrant local markets, indulge in fresh seaside eats, or embark on a scenic hike through the breathtaking Noosa National Park.\r\n \r\nThere’s a spot to drink cold beer or natural wine under a canopy of greenery, and share a meal with friends—new and old. The communal spaces invite you to stay a little longer, savouring the company and slowly sipping away in the sun.\r\n \r\nCome and stay—and experience an atmosphere that’s distinctly, and unmistakably, Australian.\r\n \r\nBOOKING A DORMITORY?
