{"type":"HOSTEL","name":"Crocodylus Hostel","nameEN":"Crocodylus Hostel","isActive":true,"isNew":false,"description":"MUST READ - VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU COME\n\nCome stay with us in the jungle on your real rainforest immersion where you can re-wild and re-earth!\n\nWe are very JUNGLY and our rooms and in fact the whole place are focussed on maximising your and fellow guests rainforest immersion experience.  We le the jungle do the talking between 9.30pm and 6am), we have no power phases during the day (10.30am-5pm) and at night (10.30pm-7am), and our rooms are minimally furnished with just a bed, a mozzie net, a couple of hooks and a bench to put things on plus a table and chairs on the verandah.  This as with the whole of our lodge, allows you to focus on re-wilding without any of the distractions of modern life.    If this does not appeal and/or you want mod-cons please cancel your booking (free of charge if done within 24hrs of booking) - you will not be happy in our re-earthing environment.\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT US\nWe have a cafe and bar (open April-Oct and closed November-March), self catering kitchen (open all year round), swimming pool, pool table, darts, lots of board games, and a large common area for eating and hanging out.\n\nIf you come outside of outside our meet and greet hours (5.30-6.30pm) you will find your room map (one will have your name on it) on a clip board at the entry steps.  Just grab your map, find your room and make yourselves at home.  We will catch up with you when we open up again.  \n\nDuring the Dry Season (APR TO OCT) our cafe is open for dinner from 5.30-7PM and breakfast from 8-9.30AM catering to vegan, vegetarian, gluten free and carnivores alike. DURING THE WET SEASON (FEB-MAR) our cafe and bar are closed however a number of small cafes can be found along the road between Cow Bay and Cape Tribulation for lunch and dinner.  Our self catering kitchen is open year round with everything you need to prepare your own food. \n\nThe lodge provides a large common area for eating and hanging out.  Please note food storage and eating are NOT are allowed in the bungalows to ensure we keep the jungle inhabitants out of your space. The self catering kitchen has BBQ, gas burners, microwave, fridges, pots pans (no oven). Cutlery and Crockery boxes are available free of charge on check-in. Let us know if you need one after 7pm if checking in late and we will leave one out for you with your map.  If you want to bring food best place to buy it is at Woolies in Mossman on the way through.  \n\nWhile all our guests are encouraged to digital detox while with us there is a charging station located in the lodges common area. To facilitate your rainforest immersion, control energy use and limit unnatural noise there are no power points in the rooms.  \n\nWater conservation is important to us too so shower times are limited to when the power is on 7-10 AM and 5-10PM - toilets and taps work all the time.  \n\nWhile with us we will help you with all things Daintree. Tours, activities, eating options and lots more.  When you arrive the best afternoon activities are the swimming pool  for cooling down or pop to our local swimming hole, Hutchinsons Creek , which is on the back of your room map.  Other afternoon options are grabbing an ice-cream, visiting the beach or doing Jindalba the national park walk behind the Discovery Centre.  These are all indicated on the back of your room map.  \n\n\nLots of things to do up here.   If you are here in the high season please let us know at least a few weeks BEFORE you come which activities you would like to participate in and we can book them for you to make sure you don't miss out.\n\nJungle Night Walk with us at Crocodylus (just let us know a day before if you are interested $35pp 7-9pm)\nRainforest Boardwalks\nZiplining with Tree Top Adventures Cape Tribulation\nNatural Swimming Holes\nBeach Horseriding with Cape Trib Horserides\n1/2 Day Reef Trips (snorkelling only) with Ocean Safari\nIndigenous Tours with Walkabout Cultural Adventures\nJungle Bugs and Butterflies Museum\nIce Cream Factories - two of them YUM\nCrocodile and Mangrove Cruises\nDaintree Discovery Centre \nBoard Games Galore plus Pool Table and Darts\nSwimming Pool (onsite)\nand lots of jungle ambience\n\nTHE TRIP HERE\nTravel north from Cairns along the fabulous coastal road towards Port Douglas. Don't turn off to Port Douglas, just continue on to Mossman, a small sugar cane farming town famous for Mossman Gorge (must do for a swim) and also a great stop for groceries if you need them. Continue heading towards Cape Tribulation until you reach the Daintree Ferry ($45 per car return you can book tickets online @daintreeferry) for a great little ride across the Daintree River - see if you can spot a Croc!.  Make sure you ask for the Daintree/Cape Tribulation map from the ferry ticket person - it is an essential guide to the area.  \n\nOnce over the ferry follow the road up over the Alexander Range and down the other side to Cow Bay. We are approximately 2km on the left down Buchanan Creek Road. \nBe sure to keep a look out for Cassowaries on the journey and enjoy the ambience on the rainforest drive.\n\nEXPLORING\nThe best way to explore the area between Cow Bay and Cape Tribulation is by car. This spectacular road is approximately 30km long and takes you through fabulous rainforest and beautiful tropical beaches. Approximately 40mins drive time if you don't stop and all day if you do stop and explore.\n\nOther things to note:\n\nWe have two weather seasons in the Daintree - dry and wet\nThe temperature is generally around 32 degrees from Nov-Mar (the Wet) and between 26-30 Apr-Oct (the Dry)\nDuring the wet season it rains a lot (can be up to 250mls in one day) however as with everywhere now it can also be dry in the wet and wet in the dry - always bring an umbrella and mozzie spray with you to the rainforest.\n\nOur lighting is set to maintain the jungle ambience and encourage wildlife to treat us just like home. So although our lighting allows you to get to your cabins and around the lodge common areas bring a good torch with you for extra light and to allow for wildlife spotlighting. See if you can spot cassowaries, Boyds Dragons, goannas, frogs, snakes, golden orb spiders and lots more while you are here.\n\nThere is only a little bit of mobile reception in the whole of the Cape Trib area for both Optus and Telstra (if you stand on one leg) so either get a $2 Optus sim for your phone from Cairns or go without.  We have limited WIFI available when the power is on\n\nWe are a licensed venue so any alcohol you bring yourself must only be consumed in your room or cabin. Storage of alcohol is not allowed in our self-catering kitchen due to storage limits so please bring an esky for your beers (ice can be bought from us or the local shop).\n\nBasic house rules of no parties, silence after 9.30pm, respect others and the environment and no smoking other than in designated smoking area (not on your balcony)\n\nAgain we are a very JUNGLY place and we make an effort to surround and immerse our guests with nature in the raw. No manicured lawns, no air conditioning, no glass and steel. We are minimalist 'glamping' in the rainforest encouraging you to re-wild and get back in touch with nature in the raw while with us.  DO NOT STAY with us if you are after mod-cons as you will NOT be happy in our re-earthing environment.\n\nWe look forward to meeting you and please don't hesitate to call or message with any further queries","hostelworldSays":null,"hostelSays":null,"location":{"address1":"Lot 5 Buchanan Creek Rd","address2":"","city":{"id":77,"name":"Cape Tribulation","nameEN":"Cape Tribulation"},"country":{"id":13,"name":"Australia","nameEN":"Australia"},"region":{"id":76,"name":"Queensland","nameEN":"Queensland"},"latitude":"-16.2230750","longitude":"145.4368840","distance":{"kilometers":13.89,"miles":8.63}},"maxGuestsPerBooking":8,"depositPercentage":15,"ratings":{"security":100,"location":100,"staff":100,"atmosphere":100,"clean":93,"facilities":93,"value":100,"overall":98,"ratingsCount":218},"groupInformation":{"listingInfo":"","terms":"Note we are a quiet low key jungle environment - bar closes around 8pm","cancellationTerms":"100% refund if cancelled more than 8 weeks before stay date\r\n50% refund if cancelled up to 2 weeks prior to stay date\r\n0% refund if cancelled within 2 weeks of stay date","additionalTerms":"50% deposit required on booking","typesNotAccepted":["STAGHENBACHELORPARTY"],"remainderDue":"ONARR","ageRangesAccepted":["0-12","12-18","18-21","21-35","35-50","50+"],"maxGuestsPerBooking":30},"currency":"AUD","houseRules":{"notes":"Here is a taste of what is available in the area:Jungle Night Walks, Rainforest Boardwalks ,Natural Swimming Holes ,Jungle Ziplining ,Beach Horseriding ,1/2 Day Reef Trips (snorkelling only),Jungle Bugs and Butterflies Museum ,Ice Cream Factories - two of them YUM ,Exotic Fruit Tasting ,Crocodile and Mangrove Cruises ,Daintree Discovery Centre ,Board Games Galore plus Pool Table and Darts ,Swimming Pool (onsite) and lots of jungle ambience.\r\n\r\nTravel north from Cairns along the fabulous coastal road towards Port Douglas.
