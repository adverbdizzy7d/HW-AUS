It's also centrally located very near Darling Harbour and the Harbour Bridge. Many Hostelworld guests tell us they'd stay here again, based on the highly-praised travel info desk and the large rooms which feature comfy beds and spacious under-bed lockers. We like that this hostel has free events every day, such as \"beach trips, yoga, running [and] VIP nights at local bars\", according to our reviewers.","hostelSays":"We offer a bunch of extras and unique features here that really set us apart from other hostels. Our own amazing bar, Scary Canary, is open 'til late with different fresh and fun activities nightly. The free weekly activities include a free guided tour over Sydney Harbour Bridge and we've got a free beach BBQ which is held on the popular Coogee Beach. Upon check-in we provide a special Base guide to Sydney city, with special offers like Sydney Tower discounts, bridge climbing, aquarium and local food and drink specials, plus an all-you-need-to-know map of Sydney. Plus our guest service desk can provide you with tax back, bank account set-up and SIM card activations and we sell cell phones and calling cards. We offer disabled-friendly rooms and a disabled toilet for our special guest needs.\r\nOnly a few minutes away we have Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and Darling Harbour, where you can see a real koala and feed a kangaroo at Featherdale Zoo, but personally I tell people they have to go to Bondi. If you're up for surfing or swimming, Bondi Beach is place to go!! Only minutes walk away is the bus stop to get on to catch some serious waves.","location":{"address1":"477 Kent Street","address2":"NSW 2000 Australia","city":{"id":81,"name":"Sydney","nameEN":"Sydney"},"country":{"id":13,"name":"Australia","nameEN":"Australia"},"region":{"id":77,"name":"New South Wales","nameEN":"New South Wales"},"latitude":"-33.8732180","longitude":"151.2050100","distance":{"kilometers":0.7,"miles":0.44}},"maxGuestsPerBooking":8,"depositPercentage":15,"ratings":{"security":90,"location":96,"staff":91,"atmosphere":80,"clean":80,"facilities":80,"value":82,"overall":86,"ratingsCount":3418},"groupInformation":{"listingInfo":"","terms":"If a group want only their group in Dorm rooms they will be required to pay for each bed in that room. i.e. the group want 5 persons in a 6 person room they are required to pay for the 6th bed unless the hostel is at liberty to put other into that bed.","cancellationTerms":"No Shows,Cancellations or room reductions within 2 weeks will be 100% non refundable","additionalTerms":"A $200 security deposit will be required on checkin and will be refunded on checkout assuming the room is left in an acceptable state.","typesNotAccepted":[],"remainderDue":"ONARR","ageRangesAccepted":["12-18","18-21","21-35","35-50"],"maxGuestsPerBooking":10},"currency":"AUD","houseRules":{"notes":"Non refundable or last minute bookings are non cancelable, non exchangeable and non refundable whatever the reason for the cancellation.
