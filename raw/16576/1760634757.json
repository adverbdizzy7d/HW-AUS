{"type":"HOSTEL","name":"YHA Hobart Central","nameEN":"YHA Hobart Central","isActive":true,"isNew":false,"description":"YHA Hobart Central is one of the most central hostels in all of Hobart we are right opposite the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, one block from the Harbour and less than 10 minutes' walk to Salamanca. \r\n\r\nOur staff hail from all over the world but have decided to call Hobart home and are more than happy to help you plan your island adventure. We know the best tour operators (hint: they're not all on Instagram) the secret spots, how to get there and how to fit it all in to your 5 day itinerary (because you probably thought Tasmania is just that little island underneath Australia, right?). \r\n\r\nIf you prefer recommendations for good coffee and amazing local produce over where to find the cheapest goon, then we're probably the hostel for you. We have regular activities that change with the season so make sure you check out our website to see what's on. \r\n\r\nReception is attended from 8am-10.30am and 2pm-8pm. If arriving outside these hours, please let us know in advance so we can arrange a self late check-in for you.\r\n\r\nPlease know that we are a cashless property.","hostelworldSays":null,"hostelSays":null,"location":{"address1":"9 Argyle Street","address2":"","city":{"id":629,"name":"Hobart","nameEN":"Hobart"},"country":{"id":13,"name":"Australia","nameEN":"Australia"},"region":{"id":82,"name":"Tasmania","nameEN":"Tasmania"},"latitude":"-42.8817542","longitude":"147.3309404","distance":{"kilometers":0.12,"miles":0.08}},"maxGuestsPerBooking":8,"depositPercentage":12,"ratings":{"security":88,"location":99,"staff":99,"atmosphere":80,"clean":87,"facilities":83,"value":83,"overall":88,"ratingsCount":350},"groupInformation":null,"currency":"AUD","houseRules":{"notes":"Notice Nearby Construction Works: Please be advised that construction is taking place next door on weekdays between 10am and 4pm for the coming weeks.
