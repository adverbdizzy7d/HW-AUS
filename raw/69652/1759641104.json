Please note the non-refundable nature of some of our booking category types.\r\n\r\nWelcome and Thanks For Checking Out Kangaroo Inn – Perth’s Best and Most Awarded Premium Backpackers.\r\n\r\nWe are the only Backpackers to have won multiple awards in the WA Tourism Awards with Silver in 2016, Gold in 2015 and Silver in 2014!\r\n\r\nWe are definitely not a party hostel but that doesn’t mean you can’t have fun during your stay here. We are close by to all of Perth’s major attractions such as the Swan River, Perth Mint, Kings Park, Art Gallery, Perth Arena, WACA and the Murray St and Hay St Malls. Public transport is also nearby whether Ferry, Bus or Train. Plus, although we are only a 10 minutes walk from the Northbridge entertainment precinct we are far enough from the noise if you want to get a good nights sleep. \r\n\r\nWhich brings us to the rooms, regardless if you choose our comfortable private rooms or budget dorm rooms you will get a good nights sleep with our 4 star hotel grade mattresses and soft cotton sheets. Private rooms (except for twin bunk rooms) get the added bonus of TVs and in room safes.\r\n\r\nAll rooms are well-appointed and include reverse-cycle air conditioning with in-room controls and ample power points to charge your devices. Linen and towels are also provided.\r\n\r\nGuests share bathroom facilities; there are dedicated mens' and ladies’ bathrooms on each floor, fitted out with luxury fixtures.\r\n\r\nKangaroo Inn has multiple common facilities including a massive basement common room, commercial kitchen, outdoor deck, a reading room, lobby/computer areas and guest laundry. Of course WiFi is available throughout the premises.\r\n\r\nLimited off street parking is also available subject to availability and fees.","hostelworldSays":null,"hostelSays":null,"location":{"address1":"123 Murray Street","address2":"","city":{"id":17,"name":"Perth","nameEN":"Perth"},"country":{"id":13,"name":"Australia","nameEN":"Australia"},"region":{"id":81,"name":"Western Australia","nameEN":"Western Australia"},"latitude":"-31.9538972","longitude":"115.8616528","distance":{"kilometers":0.33,"miles":0.21}},"maxGuestsPerBooking":8,"depositPercentage":15,"ratings":{"security":74,"location":86,"staff":63,"atmosphere":49,"clean":51,"facilities":54,"value":54,"overall":62,"ratingsCount":305},"groupInformation":{"listingInfo":"","terms":"","cancellationTerms":"50% Non-Refundable Deposit Required at Time of Booking\r\n50% Balance of Booking is Payable 1 Month Before Check-In Date\r\n\r\nNumbers can be reduced prior to the Final Payment One Month Before.
