{"type":"HOSTEL","name":"Port Macquarie Backpackers","nameEN":"Port Macquarie Backpackers","isActive":true,"isNew":false,"description":"*FREE PANCAKE BREAKFAST EVERY MORNING AT 9AM*\r\n\r\nDo not sit on the bus for 13 hours going to Byron bay, Stop at beautiful Port Macquarie! Port Macquarie Backpackers is the closest hostel to the bus stop so if you are catching the night bus it is  a straight 600m walk to your bed! You can even see the hostel from the bus stop. Impossible to get lost and you do not have to walk for miles in the middle of the night. With 24hr self-check-in, you can get a good nights sleep before exploring Port Mac! \r\n\r\nPay for your bed - the rest is free! Unlimited WiFi, Netflix, Hostel WhatsApp chat group, coffee tea & sugar, swimming pool, pool table and body boards. Join in the fun and make new friends! Pizza Night Wednesday, Pool Comp Thursday, regular movie nights, occasional trivia night, cards, puzzles and family outings to the beach, pub and night club. There is no better place or value for money to enjoy Port Macquarie!\r\n\r\nPort Macquarie Backpackers is the original and the most awarded hostel in town. \r\n\r\nPeople say Port Macquarie Backpackers has a homey feeling and that's exactly what it is, a big home! It is the 2nd oldest house in Port Macquarie and Elsinore (that's her name) has a beautiful feel about her as you walk though the big hallway, nothing like the usual sterile square box hostels you find elsewhere. Our extensive renovations in 2017 have brought her back to her old glory. Owned and operated by backpackers we have the friendliest staff on the east coast!\r\n\r\nWith 9 beaches in town there is always a good chance to have a beach almost to yourself. We have some of the nicest coast line in Australia and there is lots to see and do or just relax and chill on the veranda or swing in a hammock by the pool.\r\n\r\n24 Hr self check in. Provides you have booked for that night or the previous. \r\nPlease let us know your arrival time. If you are coming after 8.30 pm at night we will need to send you the front door code. :)\r\nIf you expect to arrive outside reception opening hours (this is between 11:30am until 5pm and after 9pm) please inform Port Macquarie Backpackers BEFORE 11am on the day of your arrival, using the contact details found on the booking confirmation. This way we can arrange a self check in for you.\r\n\r\nIf you are arriving on the 5am bus and have not paid for the previous night you can not access the hostel before 8,30 am as everybody is asleep. You can come up to the hostel, there are comfy lounges on the veranda, you can watch the sunrise and there is a great coffee shop across the road where our guests receive a $1 discount on coffee. Just let them know your part of our crew. At 8:30 you are welcome to come in and help yourself to tea, coffee and the rest of the hostel.\r\n\r\nBookings between December 15 and January 15 are non refundable and will be charged at the time of booking.\r\n\r\nBookings for the first Friday, Saturday and Sunday of May every year are non refundable and will be charged at the time of booking.
