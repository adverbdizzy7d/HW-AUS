{"type":"HOSTEL","name":"Lord Wolseley","nameEN":"Lord Wolseley","isActive":true,"isNew":false,"description":"The Lord Wolseley Hotel is also one of the oldest and smallest pubs in Sydney and certainly one of the most original. It has operated non-stop since 1881. We have great food and basic, clean and spacious accommodation at very reasonable rates.\r\n\r\nWe have queen ensuite rooms as well as queen and twin-single rooms with shared bathroom facilities. There is a bathroom for every non-ensuite room\r\n\r\nWe are happy to offer 15% off food and beverage from our bar and restaurant for all guests for the entire duration of their stay.\r\n\r\nFree Hi-speed WiFi in every room. All rooms have ceiling fans, and large opening windows\r\n\r\nWhile we do have a kitchenettes for guests on both floors of accommodation - the facilities are limited to toasters, microwaves and kettles.\r\n\r\nWe are also only several minutes walk from Sydney's world famous Chinatown , which boasts affordable dining options from all over the world.\r\n\r\nThere is a picturesque cliff-top park one-minute walk away that has free public barbecue/cooking facilities - and great sunset views!\r\n\r\nOur restaurant serves affordable and delicious meals for lunch and dinner Wednesday through to Sunday. Our ground floor public bar closes at midnight at the latest and is open 7 days.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Wolseley is a hotel that competes with hostels on price point. Although the only large common areas for guests are the bar, restaurant (and park-side seating), it is a great place to relax and meet other guests and local people.\r\n\r\nWe also have some of Australia's best jazz musicians play in the park every Sunday afternoon (weather permitting).\r\n\r\nLOCATION:\r\n\r\nWe are conveniently located near Chinatown and Central Station (Sydney's main train station) in a quiet and leafy part of historic Ultimo, adjacent to a park. Darling Harbour is a 5 minute walk away and colourful Glebe, with its markets and cafes is a ten minute stroll.\r\n\r\nAlso nearby are Surry Hills, Darlinghurst and Newtown; famous for nightlife, cafes and restaurants. Once you have seen the major attractions our staff can give local advice that isn't in the guide books.\r\n\r\nRECEPTION OPENING HOURS:\r\n\r\nMonday - Saturday : 11:30am - 11:30pm\r\n\r\nSunday: 11.30pm - 10pm\r\n\r\nCHECK IN: 1pm\r\nCHECK OUT: 10am\r\n\r\nTRAVEL FROM AIRPORT TIPS:\r\n\r\nUnless you are traveling solo the most cost effective way of getting here is by taxi.","hostelworldSays":null,"hostelSays":null,"location":{"address1":"265 Bulwara Road","address2":"Ultimo","city":{"id":81,"name":"Sydney","nameEN":"Sydney"},"country":{"id":13,"name":"Australia","nameEN":"Australia"},"region":{"id":77,"name":"New South Wales","nameEN":"New South Wales"},"latitude":"-33.8766667","longitude":"151.1966667","distance":{"kilometers":1.43,"miles":0.89}},"maxGuestsPerBooking":8,"depositPercentage":15,"ratings":{"security":87,"location":87,"staff":100,"atmosphere":93,"clean":100,"facilities":87,"value":87,"overall":91,"ratingsCount":1231},"groupInformation":null,"currency":"AUD","houseRules":{"notes":"Check out is at 10am.
