We are a cozy and relaxed place that caters primarily for international backpackers, families and couples. \r\n\r\nThe lodge is one of the oldest heritage buildings in Katoomba. The building was originally created as a primary school, subsequently transformed into a nursing home and at the end of 1970s refashioned into the guesthouse of today. \r\n\r\nWe have free WiFi, an updated tourist information board with current events and stuff happening in town, a jobs board, two warm lounge rooms with a wide selection of DVDs and TV channels, great hot showers, a tranquil & relaxing reading room and a sunny terrace with two spacious outdoor decks. \r\n\r\nOur kitchen is fully equipped to prepare your meals and we also provide free coffee and tea. There is a vegetable bed in our garden where our guests can pick fresh herbs for their dishes and we also have interesting cook books in our kitchen if you are looking for inspiration or wanting to get creative.\r\n\r\nOur reception is open daily between 10am to  7 pm.
