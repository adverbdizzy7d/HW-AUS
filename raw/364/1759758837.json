Stay your way — from funky dorms and unique teepees to private rooms if you want your own space.\r\n\r\nBy day, grab a coffee at the café, stretch out with yoga, or chill by the pool. Challenge someone at volleyball or ping pong, then kick back at the Arts Factory Garden Bar, where you can enjoy tasty, affordable Mexican eats.\r\n\r\nBy night, the bar comes alive — with DJs, karaoke, trivia, epic themed parties, and Byron’s biggest backpacker nights. Don’t miss the legendary Monday Talent Show, hosted right in the bar, where anything goes and the crowd goes wild.\r\n\r\nLooking for the real Byron Bay backpacker experience? This is where it all began — wild, welcoming, and totally one-of-a-kind.","hostelworldSays":null,"hostelSays":null,"location":{"address1":"1 Skinners Shoot Rd, Byron Bay NSW 2481","address2":"","city":{"id":378,"name":"Byron Bay","nameEN":"Byron Bay"},"country":{"id":13,"name":"Australia","nameEN":"Australia"},"region":{"id":77,"name":"New South Wales","nameEN":"New South Wales"},"latitude":"-28.6447781","longitude":"153.6043734","distance":{"kilometers":0.78,"miles":0.49}},"maxGuestsPerBooking":6,"depositPercentage":13,"ratings":{"security":91,"location":86,"staff":92,"atmosphere":85,"clean":79,"facilities":83,"value":87,"overall":86,"ratingsCount":2597},"groupInformation":{"listingInfo":"","terms":"","cancellationTerms":"","additionalTerms":"","typesNotAccepted":["JUNIORPRIMARYSCHOOL","HIGHSECONDARYSCHOOL","COLLEGEUNIVERSITY","BUSINESSTRIP","STAGHENBACHELORPARTY","SPORTSGROUP","CULTURALGROUP","HOLIDAYWITHFRIENDS"],"remainderDue":"ONARR","ageRangesAccepted":[""],"maxGuestsPerBooking":4},"currency":"AUD","houseRules":{"notes":"Nonrefundable or last minute bookings arenon cancelable, non exchangeable and non refundable whatever the reason for the cancellation.
